### Background.

##### At the moment I am not a professional. I’ll be honest, in the year and a half that I’ve been interested in computer security and technology, I haven’t acquired any hard skills in this. Soon I will start again by discarding my previous experience in this. However, during this time I gained more important skills and things. For example, I now understand exactly what I want, what I should do, how I can do it and I believe, I know that I CAN DO IT, even after a lot of time, which caused me pain and disappointment in myself. My thinking, approach to work and character have changed in many ways. In a month I will be able to start my attempts again and continue to study.

### Reality.
##### Here I will try to make a small page about myself. And also post the implementation of any ideas that may come to my mind. Right down to system setup notes to an experimental executable file.
